22 - oxacalcitriol suppresses secondary **hyperparathyroidism ** {1} without inducing low bone turnover in dogs with **renal failure ** {2} . 
{1} hyperparathyroidism (Score: 100)
{2} renal failure (Score: 100)

BACKGROUND : **Calcitriol ** {1} therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) in patients with **renal failure ** {2} but has several drawbacks , including **hypercalcemia ** {3} and / or marked suppression of bone turnover , which may lead to adynamic bone disease .

A new **vitamin D ** {1} analogue , 22 - oxacalcitriol ( OCT ) , has been shown to have promising characteristics .

This study was undertaken to determine the effects of **OCT ** {1} on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or **impaired renal function ** {2} .

{2} impaired renal function (Score: 100)

METHODS : Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized ( Nx , N = 38 ) or sham - operated ( Sham , N = 22 ) . 

The animals received supplemental phosphate to enhance PTH secretion . 

Fourteen weeks after the start of **phosphate ** {1} supplementation , half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of **OCT ** {2} ( three times per week ) ; the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks . 
{1} phosphate (Score: 100)
{2} methoctramine (Score: 90)

Thereafter , the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months . 

Biochemical and hormonal indices of **calcium ** {1} and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study , and bone biopsies were done at baseline , 60 weeks after OCT or vehicle treatment , and at the end of the crossover period . 
{1} calcium (Score: 100)

RESULTS : In Nx dogs , **OCT ** {1} significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of **renal insufficiency ** {2} .

In long - standing secondary **hyperparathyroidism ** {1} , **OCT ** {2} ( 0 . 03 microg / kg ) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months . 
{1} hyperparathyroidism (Score: 100)
{2} nocturnal leg cramps (Score: 90)

Serum PTH levels rose thereafter , but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control . 

These effects were accompanied by episodes of **hypercalcemia ** {1} and **hyperphosphatemia ** {2} . 
{1} hypercalcemia (Score: 100)
{2} hyperphosphatemia (Score: 100)

In animals with normal renal function , **OCT ** {1} induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0 . 1 microg / kg , which was not sustained with lowering of the doses . 
{1} nocturnal leg cramps (Score: 90)

In Nx dogs , OCT reversed abnormal bone formation , such as woven osteoid and **fibrosis ** {1} , but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover . 
{1} fibrosis (Score: 100)

In addition , OCT improved mineralization lag time , ( that is , the rate at which osteoid mineralizes ) in both Nx and Sham dogs . 

CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that even though **OCT ** {1} does not completely prevent the occurrence of **hypercalcemia ** {2} in experimental dogs with **renal insufficiency ** {3} , it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and , therefore , does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease .

These mechanisms are not well understood because , in most cases , the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event .

Ten patients who had **Parkinson ' s disease ** {1} with disabling **dyskinesia ** {2} were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental ( mental calculation ) and motor ( flexion / extension of right fingers , flexion / extension of left fingers , **flexion / extension of the neck ** {3} , speaking aloud ) tasks on the worsening of peak - dose **dyskinesia ** {4} following administration of an effective single dose of **apomorphine ** {5} .

Compared with the score at rest ( 1 . 3 + / - 0 . 3 ) , a significant aggravation of the **dyskinesia ** {1} score was observed during speaking aloud ( 5 . 2 + / - 1 . 1 , p < 0 . 05 ) , movements of right ( 4 . 5 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) and left ( 3 . 7 + / - 0 . 8 , p < 0 . 05 ) fingers , movements of the neck ( 5 . 1 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) , and mental calculation ( 3 . 1 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) .

Total protein , albumin , NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days . 

The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three , four , six , eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero , four , eight and thirty three . 

RESULTS : Following intravenous **PAN ** {1} urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two , but returned to normal by day four . 
{1} PAN (Score: 100)

After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin , total protein excretion and NAG activity . 

Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards . 

Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four . 

Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak **proteinuria ** {1} and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets ( day six onwards ) . 
{1} proteinuria (Score: 100)

CONCLUSIONS : This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity , occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells . 

Urine NAG activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage .
