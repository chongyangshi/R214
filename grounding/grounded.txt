METHODS : Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized ( Nx , N = 38 ) or sham - operated ( Sham , N = 22 ) . 


The animals received supplemental phosphate to enhance PTH secretion . 


Fourteen weeks after the start of **phosphate ** {1} supplementation , half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of **OCT ** {2} ( three times per week ) ; the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks .

Serum PTH levels rose thereafter , but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control . 


These effects were accompanied by episodes of **hypercalcemia ** {1} and **hyperphosphatemia ** {2} . 
{1} hypercalcemia (Score: 100)
{2} hyperphosphatemia (Score: 100)


In animals with normal renal function , **OCT ** {1} induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0 . 1 microg / kg , which was not sustained with lowering of the doses . 
{1} nocturnal leg cramps (Score: 90)


In Nx dogs , OCT reversed abnormal bone formation , such as woven osteoid and **fibrosis ** {1} , but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover . 
{1} fibrosis (Score: 100)


In addition , OCT improved mineralization lag time , ( that is , the rate at which osteoid mineralizes ) in both Nx and Sham dogs . 


CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that even though **OCT ** {1} does not completely prevent the occurrence of **hypercalcemia ** {2} in experimental dogs with **renal insufficiency ** {3} , it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and , therefore , does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease .

Total protein , albumin , NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days . 


The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three , four , six , eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero , four , eight and thirty three . 


RESULTS : Following intravenous **PAN ** {1} urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two , but returned to normal by day four . 
{1} PAN (Score: 100)


After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin , total protein excretion and NAG activity . 


Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards . 


Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four . 


Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak **proteinuria ** {1} and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets ( day six onwards ) . 
{1} proteinuria (Score: 100)


CONCLUSIONS : This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity , occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells . 


Urine NAG activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage .

RESULTS : Seven patients showed marked visual field constriction with some sparing of the temporal visual field . 


The eighth exhibited concentric constriction . 


Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits ; two patients had subnormal Arden electro - oculography indices ; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave . 


However , five patients showed delayed 30 - Hz flicker b waves , and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials . 


Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level . 


CONCLUSION : Marked visual field constriction appears to be associated with **vigabatrin ** {1} therapy .

Melatonin pre - treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate narcosis , however , no dose - effect correlation was found . 


In particular , low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis . 


In contrast , the highest dose of **melatonin ** {1} ( 50 mg / kg ) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of narcosis , and a reduction in mortality rate .

The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health - care costs and management of RIHA during treatment of **CHC ** {1} in a clinical trial setting . 
{1} CHC (Score: 100)


METHODS : A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of RIHA . 


Decision - analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating RIHA . 


Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses . 


RESULTS : RIHA , defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g / L , occurs in approximately 7 % to 9 % of patients treated with combination therapy . 


The standard of care for management of RIHA is reduction or discontinuation of the **ribavirin ** {1} dosage . 
{1} ribavirin (Score: 100)


We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA to be 170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48 - week treatment course ( range 68 - 692 ) . 


The results of the one - way sensitivity analyses ranged from 57 to 317 . 


In comparison , the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is 16 , 459 . 


CONCLUSIONS : The direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA is 1 % ( 170 / 16 , 459 ) of drug treatment costs . 


Questions remain about the optimal dose of **ribavirin ** {1} and the incidence of RIHA in a real - world population .

Low - molecular - weight **heparin ** {1} for the treatment of patients with mechanical heart valves . 
{1} heparin (Score: 100)


BACKGROUND : The interruption of oral anticoagulant ( OAC ) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves , mainly before noncardiac surgery , non - surgical interventions , and pregnancy . 


Unfractionated **heparin ** {1} ( UH ) is currently the substitute for selected patients . 
{1} heparin (Score: 100)


Low - molecular - weight **heparin ** {1} ( LMWH ) offers theoretical advantages over UH , but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to UH in patients with prosthetic valves . 
{1} heparin (Score: 100)


HYPOTHESIS : The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of LMWH in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice . 


METHODS : For this paper , the current medical literature on LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed . 


RESULTS : There were eight series and six case reports . 


None of the studies was randomized , and only one was prospective . 


Data to establish the thromboembolic risk were incomplete . 


After excluding case reports , the following groups were constructed : ( a ) short - term administration , after valve insertion ( n = 212 ) ; ( b ) short - term , perioperative ( noncardiac ) / periprocedural ( n = 114 ) ; ( c ) long - term , due to intolerance to **OAC ** {1} ( n = 16 ) ; ( d ) long - term , in pregnancy ( n = 10 ) .

The incidence rate of thromboembolism was 0 . 9 % for all the studies and 0 . 5 , 0 , 20 , and 0 % in groups a , b , c , and d , respectively ; for **hemorrhage ** {1} , the overall rate was 3 . 4 % ( 3 . 8 , 2 . 6 , 10 , and 0 % for the respective groups ) . 
{1} hemorrhage (Score: 100)


CONCLUSIONS : In patients with mechanical heart valves , short - term LMWH therapy compares favorably with UH . 


Data on mid - and long - term LMWH administration in these patients are sparse . 


Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the safety and precise indications for the use of LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves .

Oral administration of **lindane ** {1} ( 2 . 5 , 5 , 10 and 15 mg / kg , body weight ) for 5 days was found to produce a dose - dependent increase in the activity of P450 dependent 7 - ethoxyresorufin - O - deethylase ( EROD ) , 7 - pentoxyresorufin - O - dealkylase ( PROD ) and **N - nitrosodimethylamine demethylase ** {2} ( NDMA - d ) in rat brain and liver .

A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) of **lindane ** {1} was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days . 
{1} lindane (Score: 100)


As observed with different doses , the magnitude of induction in the activity of P450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain . 


Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P450 1A1 / 1A2 , 2B1 / 2B2 and 2E1 isoenzymes . 


In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD , EROD and NDMA - d are due to the increase in the levels of P450 2B1 / 2B2 , 1A1 / 1A2 and 2E1 isoenzymes , respectively . 


Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of **3 - methylcholanthrene ** {1} ( MC ) , an inducer of P4501A1 / 1A2 , did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of **lindane ** {2} induced **convulsions ** {3} , pretreatment with **phenobarbital ** {4} ( PB ) , an inducer of P450 2B1 / 2B2 or **ethanol ** {5} , an inducer of P450 2E1 catalysed reactions , significantly increased the incidence of **lindane ** {6} induced **convulsions ** {7} .

{2} acetylsalicylic acid (Score: 100)


BACKGROUND : Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) suggests that a low incidence of developmental anomalies occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during organogenesis . 


**Aspirin ** {1} ( **acetylsalicylic acid [ ASA ** {2} ] ) , an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor , induces developmental anomalies when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day ( GD ) 9 , 10 , or 11 ( Kimmel CA , Wilson JG , Schumacher HJ . Teratology 4 : 15 - 24 , 1971 ) . 
{1} aspirin (Score: 100)
{2} acetylsalicylic acid (Score: 95)


There are no published ASA studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17 . 


Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) and Wistar strains when **ASA ** {1} is administered on GD 9 , 10 , or 11 ; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats ; and to test the hypothesis that maternal **gastrointestinal toxicity ** {2} confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with ASA when a multiple dosing paradigm is used . 
{1} ASA (Score: 100)
{2} toxicity (Score: 90)


METHODS : ASA was administered as a single dose on GD 9 ( 0 , 250 , 500 , or 625 mg / kg ) , 10 ( 0 , 500 , 625 , or 750 mg / kg ) , or 11 ( 0 , 500 , 750 , or 1000 mg / kg ) and from GD 6 to GD 17 ( 0 , 50 , 125 , or 250 mg / kg a day ) in the multiple dose study to **SD ** {1} rats . 
{1} SD (Score: 100)


Animals were killed on GD 21 , and fetuses were examined viscerally . 


RESULTS : The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce **ventricular septal defects ** {1} ( VSDs ) and **midline defects ** {2} ( MDs ) in rats and **diaphragmatic hernia ** {3} ( DH ) , MDs , and VSDs in rabbits ( Cook JC et al . , 2003 ) ; hence , the present study focused on these malformations , even though **ASA ** {4} induces several other low - incidence malformations . 
{1} ventricular septal defect (Score: 100)
{2} ventricular septal and midline defects (Score: 90)
{3} diaphragmatic hernia (Score: 100)
{4} ASA (Score: 100)


In single dose studies , DH , MD , and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10 . 


VSD also was noted following treatment on GD 11 . 


In contrast , DH and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high - dose group , and VSD was noted across all dose groups . 


CONCLUSIONS : High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and hydrocephalus in the Wistar rats . 


Variations and malformations were similar when **ASA ** {1} was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis ( GDs 6 to 17 ) . 
{1} ASA (Score: 100)


It was also evident that , by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose , malformations that normally occur at low incidence , as reported from previous single dose studies , could also be induced with **ASA ** {1} given at multiple doses .

The mean initial ( preprocedure ) BIS score was 97 . 1 ( + / - 2 . 3 ; range 92 to 99 ) . 


The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66 . 9 ( + / - 14 . 4 ; range 33 to 91 ) . 


The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77 . 1 ( 95 % CI = 74 . 3 to 80 . 0 ) . 


The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the inability to repeat words was 81 . 5 ( 95 % CI = 78 . 1 to 84 . 8 ) . 


The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96 . 7 ( + / - 2 . 4 ; range 84 to 98 ) . 


The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91 . 2 ( 95 % CI = 88 . 1 to 94 . 3 ) . 


All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol . 


The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91 . 5 ( + / - 11 . 1 ; range 79 to 98 ) , and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90 . 


CONCLUSIONS : There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words . 


Furthermore , patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation , suggestive of retrograde **amnesia ** {1} .

Nerve growth factor and prostaglandins in the urine of female patients with overactive bladder . 


PURPOSE : NGF and PGs in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in urine . 


We investigated changes in urinary NGF and PGs in women with OAB . 


MATERIALS AND METHODS : The study groups included 65 women with OAB and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls . 


Evaluation included patient history , urinalysis , a voiding diary and urodynamic studies . 


Urine samples were collected . 


NGF , PGE2 , PGF2alpha and PGI2 were measured using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the groups .

This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting **alcohol ** {1} - related fetal growth impairment . 
{1} alcohol (Score: 100)


METHODS : We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief alcohol intervention study . 


The fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregnancies . 


Because intensity of **alcohol ** {1} consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes , separate analyses were conducted for the heavy ( average of > or = 5 drinks per drinking day ) alcohol consumers . 
{1} alcohol (Score: 100)


Fetal measures from the heavy - exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a nondrinking group that was representative of normal , uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinics . 


Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and **drug abuse ** {1} . 
{1} drug abuse (Score: 100)


RESULTS : Nearly half of the pregnant drinkers abstained after learning of their pregnancies . 


When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies , fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non - **alcohol ** {1} - exposed group , regardless of prior drinking patterns . 
{1} alcohol (Score: 100)


Any **alcohol ** {1} consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in reduced cerebellar growth as well as decreased cranial to body growth in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers .

CONCLUSIONS : Alterations in fetal biometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancies . 


Although the reliance on self - reported drinking is a limitation in this study , these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal alcohol effects .

DESIGN : Pooled data from 3 multicenter , double - masked , randomized , controlled , phase 2b / 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the 0 . 59 - mg or 2 . 1 - mg FA intravitreal implant or standard therapy were analyzed . 


RESULTS : During the 3 - year follow - up , 71 . 0 % of implanted eyes had an IOP increase of 10 mm Hg or more than baseline and 55 . 1 % , 24 . 7 % , and 6 . 2 % of eyes reached an IOP of 30 mm Hg or more , 40 mm Hg or more , and 50 mm Hg or more , respectively . 


Topical IOP - lowering medication was administered in 74 . 8 % of implanted eyes , and IOP - lowering surgeries , most of which were trabeculectomies ( 76 . 2 % ) , were performed on 36 . 6 % of implanted eyes . 


Intraocular pressure - lowering surgeries were considered a success ( postoperative IOP of 6 - 21 mm Hg with or without additional IOP - lowering medication ) in 85 . 1 % of eyes at 1 year . 


The rate of **hypotony ** {1} ( IOP < / = 5 mm Hg ) following IOP - lowering surgery ( 42 . 5 % ) was not different from that of implanted eyes not subjected to surgery ( 35 . 4 % ) ( P = . 09 ) .

{1} hypertension (Score: 100)


Patients were treated with oral FDC of T + A or A QD before breakfast for 12 weeks ; blood pressure ( BP ) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position . 


Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic BP ( SBP ) / diastolic BP ( DBP ) from baseline to study end and number of responders ( ie , patients who achieved target SBP / DBP < 130 / < 80 mm Hg ) at end of study . 


Tolerability was assessed by treatment - emergent adverse events , identified using physical examination , laboratory analysis , and electrocardiography . 


RESULTS : A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study ; 203 patients ( 143 men , 60 women ) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow - up ( 4 patients in the T + A group and 3 in the A group ) and considered with - drawn . 


At study end , statistically significant percentage reductions from baseline within groups and between groups were observed in SBP ( T + A [ - 27 . 4 % ] ; A [ - 16 . 6 % ] ) and **DBP ( T ** {1} + A [ - 20 . 1 % ] ; A [ - 13 . 3 % ] ) ( all , P < 0 . 05 ) .

High dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI . 


OBJECTIVE : This large - scale retrospective review evaluates the sedation profile of dexmedetomidine . 


AIM : To determine the hemodynamic responses , efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) studies . 


BACKGROUND : **Dexmedetomidine ** {1} has been used at our institution since 2005 to provide sedation for pediatric radiological imaging studies . 
{1} dex (Score: 90)


Over time , an effective protocol utilizing high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative agent has evolved . 


METHODS / MATERIALS : As part of the ongoing Quality Assurance process , data on all sedations are reviewed monthly and protocols modified as needed . 


Data were analyzed from all 747 consecutive patients who received dexmedetomidine for MRI sedation from April 2005 to April 2007 . 


RESULTS : Since 2005 , the 10 - min loading dose of our dexmedetomidine protocol increased from 2 to 3 microg . kg ( - 1 ) , and the infusion rate increased from 1 to 1 . 5 to 2 microg . kg ( - 1 ) . h ( - 1 ) . 


The current sedation protocol progressively increased the rate of successful sedation ( able to complete the imaging study ) when using dexmedetomidine alone from 91 . 8 % to 97 . 6 % ( P = 0 . 009 ) , reducing the requirement for adjuvant **pentobarbital ** {1} in the event of sedation failure with **dexmedetomidine ** {2} alone and decreased the mean recovery time by 10 min ( P < 0 . 001 ) .

Fear - potentiated startle , but not light - enhanced startle , is enhanced by anxiogenic drugs . 


RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES : The light - enhanced startle paradigm ( LES ) is suggested to model **anxiety ** {1} , because of the non - specific cue and the long - term effect . 
{1} anxiety (Score: 100)


In contrast , the fear - potentiated startle ( FPS ) is suggested to model conditioned fear . 


However , the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar . 


The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms . 


METHODS : Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha ( 2 ) - adrenoceptor antagonist **yohimbine ** {1} ( 0 . 25 - 1 . 0mg / kg ) , the **5 - HT ** {2} ( 2C ) receptor agonist **m - chlorophenylpiperazine ** {3} ( mCPP , 0 . 5 - 2 . 0mg / kg ) or the **GABA ** {4} ( A ) inverse receptor agonist **pentylenetetrazole ** {5} ( **PTZ ** {6} , 3 - 30mg / kg ) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS .

RESULTS : None of the drugs enhanced LES , whereas mCPP increased percentage FPS and yohimbine increased absolute FPS values . 


Furthermore , yohimbine increased baseline startle amplitude in the LES , while mCPP suppressed baseline startle in both the LES and FPS and **PTZ ** {1} suppressed baseline startle in the FPS .

The inferior colliculus ( IC ) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information , but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system . 


Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory **amino acid microinjection ** {1} causes freezing , escape - like behavior , and immobility .

The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla , coinciding with the raphe magnus . 


In spontaneously **hypertensive ** {1} , **stroke ** {2} - prone rats , microinjection of **methyldopa ** {3} into the area of the midline B3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent **hypotension ** {4} of 30 - 40 mm Hg , which was maximal 2 - 3 h after administration and was abolished by the **serotonin neurotoxin 5 , 7 - dihydroxytryptamine ** {5} ( 5 , 7 - DHT ) injected intracerebroventricularly .

Glycopyrronium requirements for antagonism of the muscarinic side effects of edrophonium . 


We have compared , in 60 adult patients , the cardiovascular effects of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg - 1 and 10 micrograms kg - 1 given either simultaneously or 1 min before edrophonium 1 mg kg - 1 . 


Significant differences between the four groups were detected ( P less than 0 . 001 ) . 


Both groups receiving 10 micrograms kg - 1 showed increases in heart rate of up to 30 beat min - 1 ( 95 % confidence limits 28 - 32 beat min - 1 ) . 


Use of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg - 1 provided greater cardiovascular stability and , given 1 min before the edrophonium , was sufficient to minimize early , edrophonium - induced bradycardias . 


This low dose of glycopyrronium provided good control of oropharyngeal secretions .

{1} headache (Score: 100)
{2} nausea (Score: 100)


All of these symptoms , probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents , were of mild degree and no special treatment was required . 


Intraplatelet cAMP content was gradually but significantly increased to 9 . 84 + / - 4 . 59 pmol per 10 ( 9 ) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value ( 6 . 87 + / - 2 . 25 pmol ) . 


The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted . 


In conclusion , the combined administration of BPT / CLZ is safe at doses used in the study , though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated .

{1} PG (Score: 100)


The effect of intra - arterial PGE2 could not be blocked by intra - arterial RP 67 , 580 or SR 48 , 968 , which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra - arterial PGE2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the **PG ** {1} was given intravesically . 
{1} PG (Score: 100)


The present results thus suggest that intra - arterial PGE2 , given near the bladder , may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor . 


However , when given intravesically , PGE2 may stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and / or immediately below the urothelium . 


These tachykinins , in turn , initiate a micturition reflex by stimulating NK1 and NK2 receptors .

{1} pilocarpine (Score: 100)


Additional neuronanatomical studies , including cresyl violet staining , neuronal degeneration methods , and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein , suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons was related to **neuronal loss ** {1} rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels . 
{1} neuronal loss (Score: 100)


The loss of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer . 


Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals . 


No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer , which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer . 


The results indicate that , in this model , a subpopulation of GAD mRNA - containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to **seizure ** {1} - induced damage .

{1} hypertension (Score: 100)


After 8 weeks of therapy , in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled , 5 mg amlodipine was added to the initial therapy . 


Patients were assessed at 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks . 


The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks . 


Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates . 


RESULTS : Both valsartan and amlodipine were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks . 


Similar decreases were observed in both groups , with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed . 


For the primary variable the difference was 0 . 5 mm Hg in favor of **valsartan ** {1} ( p = 0 . 68 ; 95 % confidence interval , - 2 . 7 to 1 . 7 ) .

The results of these studies demonstrated that CS - mediated protection is not selective for a particular species , organ system or toxic chemical . 


A 24 - h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of **CS ** {1} ( 100mg / kg , i . p . ) , resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of **CCl4 ** {2} , CHCl3 , **acetaminophen ** {3} and galactosamine and against the lethal ( and presumably cardiotoxic ) effect of **adriamycin ** {4} administration .

Maximal CS - mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult . 


These data suggest that CS intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to **toxic cell death ** {1} . 
{1} death (Score: 90)


The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate ( in light of the protection observed against galactosamine **hepatotoxicity ** {1} ) . 
{1} hepatotoxicity (Score: 100)


However , based on the data presented , we can not exclude the possibility that CS administration inhibits chemical bioactivation . 


Our findings do suggest that CS - mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic CS molecule ( non - hydrolyzable CSE was as protective as CS ) , whose mechanism has yet to be defined .

We report peroxidase - antiperoxidase immunostaining for NPY in several brain regions in this model . 


PILO - injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals , in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and , in a few cases , within presumed granule cells . 


NPY immunoreactivity was also dramatically changed in the entorhinal cortex , amygdala and sensorimotor areas . 


In addition , PILO injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY - immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls . 


The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression , including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons , are present in the PILO model of TLE . 


However , the significance of this changed synthesis of NPY remains to be determined .

PATIENTS AND METHODS : A total of 329 patients enrolled in the study at 24 centers . 


All patients had a pre - therapy Gram ' s stain and culture of sinus exudate obtained by antral puncture or nasal endoscopy . 


Clinical response was assessed on the basis of signs and symptoms and sinus radiograph or computed tomography results . 


Microbiologic cure rates were determined on the basis of presumed plus documented eradication of the pre - therapy pathogen ( s ) . 


RESULTS : The most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus , and Moraxella catarrhalis . 


Of 300 clinically evaluable patients , 175 ( 58 % ) were cured and 90 ( 30 % ) were improved at the post - therapy evaluation , resulting in a clinical success rate of 88 % . 


Thirty - five patients ( 12 % ) clinically failed treatment . 


The microbiologic eradication rate ( presumed plus documented ) among 138 microbiologically evaluable patients was 92 % . 


Microbiologic eradication rates ( presumed plus documented ) of the most common pathogens ranged from 93 % ( M . catarrhalis ) to 100 % ( S . pneumoniae ) at the post - therapy visit . 


All but one of the 265 patients who were cured or improved at post - therapy returned for a long - term follow - up visit ; 243 ( 92 % ) remained well 4 to 6 weeks after therapy ; and 21 ( 8 % ) had a relapse of symptoms .

At various times during treatment , the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for **heart tissue damage ** {1} by electron microscopy . 
{1} tissue damage (Score: 95)


In parallel , total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady - state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII , COXIII , and COXIV genes . 


Similarly , samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies . 


Our results indicated that 1 ) treatment of mice with **ADR ** {1} caused **cardiovascular arrhythmias ** {2} characterized by **bradycardia ** {3} , extension of ventricular depolarization time ( tQRS ) , and failure of QRS at high concentrations ( 10 - 14 mg / kg body weight cumulative dose ) ; 2 ) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling , fusion , dissolution , and / or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment . 
{1} ADR (Score: 100)
