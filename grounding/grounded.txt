 In particular , low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis .

 RESULTS : The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce *ventricular*[1] *septal*[2] *defects*[3] ( VSDs ) and *midline*[4] *defects*[5] ( MDs ) in rats and *diaphragmatic*[6] *hernia*[7] ( DH ) , MDs , and VSDs in rabbits ( Cook JC et al . , 2003 ) ; hence , the present study focused on these malformations , even though *ASA*[8] induces several other low - incidence malformations .

 In contrast , DH and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high - dose group , and VSD was noted across all dose groups .
()
 CONCLUSIONS : High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and hydrocephalus in the Wistar rats .

 It was also evident that , by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose , malformations that normally occur at low incidence , as reported from previous single dose studies , could also be induced with *ASA*[1] given at multiple doses .

[1] PG (Score: 100)
()
 The effect of intra - arterial PGE2 could not be blocked by intra - arterial RP 67 , 580 or SR 48 , 968 , which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra - arterial PGE2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the *PG*[1] was given intravesically .

 The present results thus suggest that intra - arterial PGE2 , given near the bladder , may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor .
()
 However , when given intravesically , PGE2 may stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and / or immediately below the urothelium .

 However , based on the data presented , we can not exclude the possibility that CS administration inhibits chemical bioactivation .
()
 Our findings do suggest that CS - mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic CS molecule ( non - hydrolyzable CSE was as protective as CS ) , whose mechanism has yet to be defined .

 We report peroxidase - antiperoxidase immunostaining for NPY in several brain regions in this model .
()
 PILO - injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals , in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and , in a few cases , within presumed granule cells .
()
 NPY immunoreactivity was also dramatically changed in the entorhinal cortex , amygdala and sensorimotor areas .
()
 In addition , PILO injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY - immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls .
()
 The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression , including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons , are present in the PILO model of TLE .

 However , the significance of this changed synthesis of NPY remains to be determined .
